# IEEE VIS Workshop on Visualization Education, Literacy, and Activities

This workshop focuses on visualization education, literacy, and activities and will be held on *23 October 2023* at [IEEE VIS](https://ieeevis.org/) in *Melbourne, Australia*. It intends to bring together scholars to share research and experience and discuss novel activities, teaching methods, and research challenges. The workshop aims to serve as a platform for scholars within and beyond the visualization community such as education, learning analytics, science communication, psychology, or people from adjacent fields such as data science, AI, and HCI. It will include presentations of research papers and practical sessions with hands-on activities. In addition, the workshop will allow participants to discuss challenges they face in data visualization education and outline a research agenda of visualization education, literacy, and activities.

## Keynote

**Title:** *Data Storytelling in Learning Analytics … and its intertwined relationship with visualisation literacy*

Data is omnipresent, yet that doesn't necessarily make us more knowledgeable. The ultimate goal of data analytics is to extract key insights from data to inform decision-making. In education, this is the mission of the fast-growing field of Learning Analytics. This area employs a variety of data-centric tools, from data visualizations to intricate predictive models, to enhance teaching and learning. Yet, the primary objective is to "close the analytics loop" by delivering actionable feedback or recommendations directly to students and educators. This presents a challenge in human-data interaction. Currently, most end-user learning analytics interfaces rely on dashboards featuring various data visualizations, which are often complex and hard to interpret by students and teachers. But the question remains: Can we do better than simply showing charts to students and teachers?

In this keynote, I will discuss about our most recent work in bringing Data Storytelling to Learning Analytics in various collaborative learning settings. This is an emerging approach that shifts the focus from visualising data points to the narratives that can be derived from them. This can be accomplished in several ways, such as combining visualizations with narrative to convey insights, crafting text-based learning analytics tools, experimenting with alternative visualisation techniques like data comics, or developing analytics tools that teachers can use to guide students' reflection. We have also explored whether data storytelling provides more support to audiences with lower visualization literacy.  

**BIO:** Dr. Roberto Martinez-Maldonado received the Ph.D. degree in Information Technologies from the University of Sydney, in 2014. He is currently a Senior Lecturer of Learning Analytics and Human-Computer Interaction with the Faculty of Information Technology and Coordinator of the Centre for Learning Analytics with Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia. He is a co-author of numerous research papers. He is the first Mexican-Australian to win the Swiss-based Jacobs Foundation Research Fellowship (2021–23) for his pioneering research in Human-Centred AI in Education. His research focuses on advancing the understanding of socio-technical issues around the use of artificial intelligence in education, promoting the use of human-centred methodologies to create learning analytics interfaces with integrity and enhancing authentic learning spaces with multimodal data-intensive computing capabilities. He has been Program Chair of the International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge and the International Conference of Artificial Intelligence in Education and he is a regular Associate Chair of the Learning and Education subcommittee of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. He is Associate Editor of the International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education. 



## Workshop goals and scope of topics

With this workshop, we want to achieve the following goals: 
* build a forum and interdisciplinary community around teaching data visualization, open to researchers, students, and practitioners outside the traditional VIS community
* share research on visualization literacy, education and teaching, and practices
* collect, test, and systematize learning activities
* discuss best practices and challenges concerning visualization education and literacy

The **workshop topics** include, but are not limited to:
* Visualization literacy
* Learning goals and learning methods
* Evaluation methods and learning analytics
* Educational tools
* Visualization activities
* Pedagogy in visualization
* Teaching in different scenarios (onsite, online, hybrid)
* Reflective and research practices
* Understanding and teaching to diverse audiences (e.g., children/adult learning, data journalists/data scientists/computer scientists/designers) 
* Guidelines, strategies, and guidance for education
* Debate and discussions on visualization guidelines and well-established knowledge
* Knowledge dissemination
* Challenges and personal experiences
* Informal learning
* Experiential learning (hands-on learning & physicalization)
* Visualizations for public education (e.g., health education, science communication)
* Engagement with visualizations
* Teaching approaches that encourage creativity and design critique
* Accessibility of visualization learning resources

## Call for Submission

The workshop accepts two types of submissions: 
* **Research papers:** authors are encouraged to submit a paper of length proportional to its contribution (submissions are expected to be minimum of 2 pages to a maximum of 8 pages excluding references, intended for publication through the IEEE Xplore DL).
Research papers must follow the formatting guidelines for [VGTC Conference Style Template.](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/).
We will use the  [Precision Conference System (PCS)](https://new.precisionconference.com/) for the research paper submission and reviewing process. We allow both double-blind (anonymized) and single-blind (not anonymized) submissions.
* **Activities:** practical reports that describe how an activity is conducted and how it could be reused by others and in other contexts; these activity reports will be published on the workshop website (not for publication in IEEE Xplore DL).
Activities must follow the following [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QM_YtQduTlBjA459URkbUFg9NU9V6W2aJLVT3RoEk5Y/edit?usp=sharing) and submitted via email to ieee-eduvis@googlegroups.com.

At least one author per accepted paper must register for IEEE VIS and present the work at the workshop, which will take place on 22 or 23 October 2023 during the conference in Melbourne, Australia. There is no online or hybrid participation planned this year.
