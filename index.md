# IEEE VIS Workshop on Visualization Education, Literacy, and Activities 2025

This is the 3<sup>rd</sup> workshop on visualization education, literacy, and activities. This half-day workshop happens with the [IEEE VIS 2025](https://ieeevis.org/year/2025/welcome) conference in Vienna (Austria).
The workshop aims to become the primary forum to share and discuss advances, challenges, and methods at the intersection of visualization and education. It addresses an interdisciplinary audience from and beyond visualization, education, learning analytics, science communication, arts and design, psychology, or people from adjacent fields such as data science and HCI.

In its 3rd edition, we introduce annual spotlight topics, with this year’s topic being **Modalities of learning and engaging**. This also includes topics of education for visualization (ed4vis) as well as visualization for education (vis4ed). It will include presentations of **research papers** published in the IEEE Xplore library, **educator reports** published in the Nightingale Magazine, and discussion and vis activities in **working groups**.

The full workshop proposal is available [here](IEEE-EduVis-Workshop-2025.pdf).

## Workshop goals and scope of topics

With this workshop, we want to achieve the following goals:

* Build a forum and interdisciplinary community around teaching data visualization, open to researchers, students, and practitioners outside the traditional VIS community
* Share research on visualization literacy, education and teaching, and practices
* Collect, test, and systematize learning activities
* Discuss best practices and challenges concerning visualization education and literacy
* Experience hands-on sessions with visualization games and playful learning activities
* Attend discussion groups for in-depth conversations on various topics


The **workshop topics** include, but are not limited to:

* Modalities (e.g., videos, comics, serious games)
* Visualization Activities & Games
* Engagement with visualizations
* Generative AI and visualization (in learning and assessment)
* Visualization literacy and pedagogy in visualization
* Learning goals and learning methods
* Evaluation methods and learning analytics
* Educational tools
* Hybrid and online teaching
* Reflective and research practices
* Understanding audiences
* Guidelines, strategies, and guidance for education
* Debate and discussions on visualization guidelines and well-established knowledge
* Challenges and personal experiences
* Experiential learning (hands-on learning and physicalization)
* Visualizations for public education (e.g., health education, science communication)
* Teaching to encourage creativity and design critique
* Accessibility of visualization learning resources

## Submission Guidelines and Reviewing Process

The workshop will accept two types of submissions, peer-reviewed by at least two PC members and one workshop organizer.

**Paper submissions**: full papers (4–8 pages excluding references, must follow the formatting guidelines for VGTC Conference Style Template); submissions will be published at the IEEE Xplore with authors’ permission. Note: Similar to the VIS paper stream, we accept both double-blind (anonymized) and single-blind (not anonymized) submissions.

**Educator reports**: short reports (1–2 pages, template agnostic) to discuss opinions or reflections on teaching experiences or describe the results of a datavis activity conducted and how it could be reused by others and in other contexts; they will be published in the Nightingale magazine (pre-arranged with the Data Visualization Society). This is not intended to be assessed as scientific writing; we recommend framing these reports similar to blog posts. The goal of these reports is to disseminate knowledge to non-academic audiences.

At least one author for each paper or educator report must register and attend the conference in person.
