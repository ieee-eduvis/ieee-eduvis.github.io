# IEEE VIS Workshop on Visualization Education, Literacy, and Activities

This workshop focuses on visualization education, literacy, and activities and will be held in _October 2023_ at [IEEE VIS](https://ieeevis.org/) in _Melbourne, Australia_. It intends to bring together junior and senior scholars to share research and experience and to discuss novel activities, teaching methods, and research challenges. The workshop aims to serve as a platform for interdisciplinary researchers within and beyond the visualization community such as education, learning analytics, science communication, psychology, or people from adjacent fields such as data science, AI, and HCI. It will include presentations of research papers and practical reports, as well as hands-on activities. In addition, the workshop will allow participants to discuss challenges they face in data visualization education and sketch a research agenda of visualization education, literacy, and activities. 
See the [full proposal here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10708).

## Workshop goals and scope of topics

With this workshop, we want to achieve the following goals: 
* build a forum and interdisciplinary community around teaching data visualization, open to researchers, students, and practitioners outside the traditional VIS community
* publish research on visualization literacy, education and teaching, activities, and practices, etc.
* discuss best practices to teach data visualization to diverse audiences (e.g., children, data journalists, data scientists, computer scientists, designers) and in different scenarios (onsite, online, hybrid)
* share visualization educational tools, material, and processes
* collect, test, and systematize learning activities
* discuss higher-level issues concerning human-centered approaches to visualization, visualization design, and education

The *workshop topics* include, but are not limited to:
* Visualization literacy
* Learning goals and learning methods
* Evaluation methods and learning analytics
* Educational tools
* Visualization activities
* Pedagogy in visualization
* Hybrid and online teaching
* Reflective and research practices
* Understanding audiences
* Guidelines, strategies, and guidance for education
* Debate and discussions on visualization guidelines and well-established knowledge
* Knowledge dissemination
* Challenges and personal experiences
* Informal learning
* Experiential learning (hands-on learning & physicalization)
* Visualizations for public education (e.g., health education, science communication)
* Engagement with visualizations
* Teaching approaches that encourage creativity and design critique
* Accessibility of visualization learning resources

## Call for Submission

The workshop accepts three types of submissions: 
* Full papers (6-8 pages excluding references, intended for publication through the IEEE DL)
* Short papers (2-4 pages excluding references, not for publication in IEEE DL)
* Activities: practical reports that describe how an activity is conducted and how it could be reused by others and in other contexts; these activity reports will be published on the workshop website (not for publication in IEEE DL).

Full and short papers must follow the formatting guidelines for [IEEE VIS TVCG Journal submissions](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/journal/). We will use the  [Precision Conference System (PCS)](https://new.precisionconference.com/) for the submission and reviewing process.
