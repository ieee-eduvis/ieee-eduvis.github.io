# IEEE VIS Workshop on Visualization Education, Literacy, and Activities

This workshop focuses on visualization education, literacy, and activities and will be held in _October 2023_ at [IEEE VIS](https://ieeevis.org/) in _Melbourne, Australia_. It intends to bring together scholars to share research and experience and discuss novel activities, teaching methods, and research challenges. The workshop aims to serve as a platform for scholars within and beyond the visualization community such as education, learning analytics, science communication, psychology, or people from adjacent fields such as data science, AI, and HCI. It will include presentations of research papers and practical sessions with hands-on activities. In addition, the workshop will allow participants to discuss challenges they face in data visualization education and outline a research agenda of visualization education, literacy, and activities. 

See the [full proposal here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10708).

## Workshop goals and scope of topics

With this workshop, we want to achieve the following goals: 
* build a forum and interdisciplinary community around teaching data visualization, open to researchers, students, and practitioners outside the traditional VIS community
* share research on visualization literacy, education and teaching, and practices
* collect, test, and systematize learning activities
* discuss best practices and challenges concerning visualization education and literacy

The **workshop topics** include, but are not limited to:
* Visualization literacy
* Learning goals and learning methods
* Evaluation methods and learning analytics
* Educational tools
* Visualization activities
* Pedagogy in visualization
* Teaching in different scenarios (onsite, online, hybrid)
* Reflective and research practices
* Understanding and teaching to diverse audiences (e.g., children/adult learning, data journalists/data scientists/computer scientists/designers) 
* Guidelines, strategies, and guidance for education
* Debate and discussions on visualization guidelines and well-established knowledge
* Knowledge dissemination
* Challenges and personal experiences
* Informal learning
* Experiential learning (hands-on learning & physicalization)
* Visualizations for public education (e.g., health education, science communication)
* Engagement with visualizations
* Teaching approaches that encourage creativity and design critique
* Accessibility of visualization learning resources

## Call for Submission

The workshop accepts two types of submissions: 
* **Research papers:** authors are encouraged to submit a paper of length proportional to its contribution (submissions are expected to be minimum of 2 pages to a maximum of 8 pages excluding references, intended for publication through the IEEE Xplore DL).
Research papers must follow the formatting guidelines for [VGTC Conference Style Template.](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/).
We will use the  [Precision Conference System (PCS)](https://new.precisionconference.com/) for the research paper submission and reviewing process. We allow both double-blind (anonymized) and single-blind (not anonymized) submissions.
* **Activities:** practical reports that describe how an activity is conducted and how it could be reused by others and in other contexts; these activity reports will be published on the workshop website (not for publication in IEEE Xplore DL).
Activities must follow the following [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QM_YtQduTlBjA459URkbUFg9NU9V6W2aJLVT3RoEk5Y/edit?usp=sharing) and submitted via email to ieee-eduvis@googlegroups.com.

At least one author per accepted paper must register for IEEE VIS and present the work at the workshop, which will take place on 22 or 23 October 2023 during the conference in Melbourne, Australia. There is no online or hybrid participation planned this year.
